          I landed my first gig today! I'm going to be redesigning a website for
          an old client. I had designed and developed her current site back in
          2016. It looks way dated and needs a lil sprucing up. I contacted her,
          setup a meeting, and agreed to redesign her site. AND get this - it's
          PAID! This will be a great addition to my portfolio, fingers-crossed.
          Now it's on to the design. I started by using the EOT site as a
          template. It may as well go to use. I also learned a little bit about
          microservice architecture - creating DBs for each microservice and
          setting up events that communicate when the data has changed for each
          microservice. I also worked through an eCommerce MERN stack tutorial.
          The end result should look craaaazy! However, I need to familiarize
          myself with Express a bit more. Ohhhhh... and I learned some new
          things in Figma. Like Auto-sizing (this is way cool!!!). It'll come in
          handy for the Salcedo site.

        <h5>Material UI / CSS Modules</h5>

          Today was trying. Very trying. I did a bit of studying of CSS modules
          and implemented them in a small project. They seem suitable only for
          small projects. I created a separate CSS Module for each React
          component. This ended up creating a ton of Modules. I'm sure there's a
          better way. I also looked into Material UI and React Bootstrap. They
          seem cool. I think I prefer React Bootstrap. Still much to learn. Oh,
          and I built this Blog. It's unorganized at the moment, and is storing
          my blogs in a Blog.js component. Obviously, it will not stay this way,
          but it's something to document my progress. I'll fix this up at a
          later date but will keep posting here daily.
